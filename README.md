# Yelp Data Challenge : What Makes a Review Useful Funny or Cool?
Ziyang Gao, Lichun Gao, Yang Wu, Mingjie Zeng
## Abstract
In this project, we used the Yelp Data Challenge dataset to explore the useful/funny/cool tag with the text.  The goal of this project is to determine the useful/funny/cool label of a given review text. Moreover, we want to extend the aim of deciding how useful/funny/cool a review is. Thus, we propose two main methods to achieve our goal: multi-label classification for tag identification, multi-class regression for tag score prediction.
